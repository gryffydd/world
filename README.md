# world

World is based on Predator Prey relationships where there are multiple
species

The idea is that a species is identified by a genome.  The genome is
encoded in DNA which can be thought of as a series of ones and zeros
which can be also thought of as a number.

Each species can be though of as having attributes expressed by the genome.
In identifying what is a Predator and what is Prey we will make a rule that
a species can eat another if it has one less bit.
